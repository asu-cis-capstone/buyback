# Buyback Boss

###Overview
Our team will be creating a comprehensive referral program for Buyback Boss, a recommerce business, to increase traffic to the site by using customer-to-customer marketing.  The referral program will also give the business a personal touch by persuading customers who may be skeptical about selling their phone online with their own friends' testimonials. 

The referral program will be modeled after several recently successful programs such as Uber, Lyft, and Birchbox and will be integrated into the client's existing website.  The team will utilize HTML, PHP, Java, and a PHPmyAdmin database to fulfill the client's needs.  

**The client’s needs:**
  * A functional referral system that does not require a user login. 
  * A means for customers to share each purchase on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media outlets.
  * Branding that is consistent with the current website. 

**The client’s wants:**
  * An automatic email sent to customers when their referral code is used.
  * A clickable link which points to his site with the referral code already attached to the order form.
  * An option for customers to become “ambassadors” for the company (i.e., “We will send you referral cards to give to your friends!”)
  * Bulk payment processing for referral cash
  * A back-end solution to analyze the ROI for the referral program (i.e., what percent of customers refer? On average how many customers does each person refer?)
