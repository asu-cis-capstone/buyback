# Buyback Boss Testing Plan

###Overview of Testing Plan
Our team plans to utilize 3 different testing mechanisms to analyze the effectiveness of basic site design and referral program.  The three sources we plan to use are:
   * Real user testing 
   * Usability Hub
   * Insert Automated Testing Program
 
Our team and client have come up with the following useful test cases: 

**Test cases:**
  * User navigates to BuybackBoss.com to sell his 16GB iPhone 5 on Verizon. The user wants to be paid by check and does not have a box to send his phone in.
  * User navigates to BuybackBoss.com to sell device of choice and wants to share referral code to friends via Twitter.
  * User navigates to BuyBackBoss.com to sell device of choice and uses made up referral code.
  * User navigates to BuyBackBoss.com to sell device of choice and inputs name that contains numbers.
  * User navigates to BuyBackBoss.com to sell their 8GB Verizon iPhone 4. The user attempts to enter their own referral code to receive an extra $10.
  * A previous user navigates to BuyBackBoss.com to sell their Unlocked 32GB iPhone 5C. When filling in their information, they enter it all the same as before, except for the phone number.
  

**Interpretation of Results:**
