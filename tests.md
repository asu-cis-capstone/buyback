# Buyback Boss Testing Plan

###Overview of Testing Plan
Our team plans to utilize 3 different testing mechanisms to analyze the effectiveness of basic site design and referral program.  The three sources we plan to use are:
   * Real user testing 
   * Usability Hub
   * Insert Automated Testing Program
 
Our team and client have come up with the following useful test cases: 

**Test cases:**
  1. User navigates to BuybackBoss.com to sell his 16GB iPhone 5 on Verizon. The user wants to be paid by check and does not have a box to send his phone in.
  2. User navigates to BuybackBoss.com to sell device of choice and wants to share referral code to friends via Twitter.
  3. User navigates to BuyBackBoss.com to sell device of choice and uses made up referral code.
  4. User navigates to BuyBackBoss.com to sell device of choice and inputs name that contains numbers.
  5. User navigates to BuyBackBoss.com to sell their 8GB Verizon iPhone 4. The user attempts to enter their own referral code to receive an extra $10.
  6. A previous user navigates to BuyBackBoss.com to sell their Unlocked 32GB iPhone 5C. When filling in their information, they enter it all the same as before, but enter in a new phone number.
  7. User tries to sell a Verizon iPhone 5 32GB and as he/she is filling out information realizes itâ€™s a 16GB and has to go back to change the size of the iPhone
  8. User buys any phone of their choice and tries to put in a referral code but caps lock is on, on their box.
