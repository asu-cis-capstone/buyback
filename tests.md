# Buyback Boss Testing Plan

###Overview of Testing Plan
Our team plans to utilize 3 different testing mechanisms to analyze the effectiveness of basic site design and referral program.  The three sources we plan to use are:
   * Real user testing 
   * Usability Hub
  * [Insert Automated Testing Program]
 These three forms of testing will allow for a diverse set of results that will analyze the aforementioned goals.  We plan to test our site accross all four main browsers: Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari.  This will verify that all browser types support the new site design and referral program.  
 
 Our team and client have come up with the following useful test cases:
